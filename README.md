## Why
I couldn't find a basic, easy postcss set up for experimentation with the [Shoelace framework](https://github.com/claviska/shoelace-css), so here's my attempt.

## To get it working

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run process-css`
3. You can check out index.html to make sure that the css compiled correctly.
